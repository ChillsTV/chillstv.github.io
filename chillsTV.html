            <h3>In this study, we are curious about <span style = "color: black">Frisson</span>.<br>
        <br>
        Frisson is a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that 
        often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state.
        It is the internal, spreading shivers we sometimes experience when watching a video, 
        listening to music, or in social situations.<br>
        <br>
        Generally, they correspond to 
        a sensation of feeling cold down your spine. 
        Sometimes, frisson is accompanied by goosebumps. 
        We use Chills and Frisson as synonyms. </h3>
